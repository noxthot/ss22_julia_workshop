# Not the most efficient way of computing $\pi$

As we very well know, there are a lot of ways to compute $\pi$. There is even a [blog entry](https://julialang.org/blog/2017/03/piday/) in the Julia blog for that. Nevertheless, we decided for a different method (that is part of the introductory courses on [JuliaAcademy](https://juliaacademy.com/)).

A circle with radius $r$ has an area of 
$$A_{circle} = \pi r^2$$
and the square that encases it 
$$A_{square} = 4 r^2.$$

The ratio between the area of the circle and the area of the square is 
$$
\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = \frac{\pi r^2}{4 r^2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
$$
and therefore we can define $\pi$ as
$$
\pi = 4\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}}.
$$
The same is true if we just take the first quadrant, so $\frac14$ of the square as well as the circle. This simplification will make the code more compact and faster. 

The above formula suggests that we can compute $\pi$ by a [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). Actually this example is also included in the Wiki article and it comes with this nice gif.

The algorithm therefore becomes:
1. For a given number $N$ of uniformly scattered points in the quadrant determine if these points are in the circle (distance less than 1) or not. We call the number of points in the circle $M$. 
1. Estimate $\pi$ by computing 
$$
\pi \approx 4  \frac{M}{N}.
$$

\exercise{
Implement the above described algorithm to compute $\pi$.
1. Define a function that determines $M$ for a given integer $N$.
1. Define a function that estimates $\pi$ for a given function $f$ and integer $N$.
1. Test your code with different values for $N$.

Help: The function `rand()` will give you a uniformly scattered point in the interval $[0,1]$.
